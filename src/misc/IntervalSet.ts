/**
 * This class implements the {@link IntSet} backed by a sorted array of
 * non-overlapping intervals. It is particularly efficient for representing
 * large collections of numbers, where the majority of elements appear as part
 * of a sequential range of numbers that are all part of the set. For example,
 * the set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 } may be represented as { [1, 4], [7, 8] }.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is able to represent sets containing any combination of values in
 * the range {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE} to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}
 * (inclusive).</p>
