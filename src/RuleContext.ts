/** A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.
 *
 *  We form a stack of these context objects using the parent
 *  pointer. A parent pointer of null indicates that the current
 *  context is the bottom of the stack. The ParserRuleContext subclass
 *  as a children list so that we can turn this data structure into a
 *  tree.
 *
 *  The root node always has a null pointer and invokingState of -1.
 *
 *  Upon entry to parsing, the first invoked rule function creates a
 *  context object (asubclass specialized for that rule such as
 *  SContext) and makes it the root of a parse tree, recorded by field
 *  Parser._ctx.
 *
 *  public final SContext s() throws RecognitionException {
 *      SContext _localctx = new SContext(_ctx, getState()); <-- create new node
 *      enterRule(_localctx, 0, RULE_s);                     <-- push it
 *      ...
 *      exitRule();                                          <-- pop back to _localctx
 *      return _localctx;
 *  }
 *
 *  A subsequent rule invocation of r from the start rule s pushes a
 *  new context object for r whose parent points at s and use invoking
 *  state is the state with r emanating as edge label.
 *
 *  The invokingState fields from a context object to the root
 *  together form a stack of rule indication states where the root
 *  (bottom of the stack) has a -1 sentinel value. If we invoke start
 *  symbol s then call r1, which calls r2, the  would look like
 *  this:
 *
 *     SContext[-1]   <- root node (bottom of the stack)
 *     R1Context[p]   <- p in rule s called r1
 *     R2Context[q]   <- q in rule r1 called r2
 *
 *  So the top of the stack, _ctx, represents a call to the current
 *  rule and it holds the return address from another rule that invoke
 *  to this rule. To invoke a rule, we must always have a current context.
 *
 *  The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
 *  getting error information.
 *
 *  These objects are used during parsing and prediction.
 *  For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass
 *  ParserRuleContext.
