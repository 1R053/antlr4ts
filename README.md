# antlr4ts
TypeScript/JavaScript target for ANTLR 4

## Dev setup
Of course, you'll need to install Node.js for your platform.   https://nodejs.org/en/
After cloning the repository, you can install dependencies by changing into the cloned directory and typing:

```
npm Install
```
you will need to do this again as we take on new dependencies or updates. 

### Running basic tests should be as simple as...
```
npm Test
```
How we integrate with runtime-testsuite is TBD.
